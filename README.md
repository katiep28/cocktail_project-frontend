# cocktail_project-frontend

This is the front end of the Cocktail Web based Application, built during the Tech Returners Project phase. It integrates with a backend which is in the Organisation, Team Cocoktail repository.

The main driver behind the project was to be able to search for cocktails based on what drinks you had in your cupboard. We also added 2 other searches to enable you to search for a specific cocktail and also choose any one of the cocktails from the database.

Once you have chosen the cocktail the recipe is displayed on how to make it.

The hosted version of the application is available here: https://katiep28.github.io/cocktail_project-frontend/.
